# Introduction

`Django-CRON` is a data management project that automates the handling of CSV files through a customized Django admin panel. The system processes incoming CSV data, stores it in a `PostgreSQL database`, and utilizes `Docker containerization` with `CRON scheduling` for automated data exports.

The project addresses common data management challenges by providing:

- A streamlined `CSV import process` with data validation.
- A user-friendly `custom admin interface` for data visualization and management.
- Automated hourly data exports through `CRON jobs` running in Docker containers.
- Reliable `PostgreSQL database storage` with proper data versioning.

This solution is particularly valuable for organizations needing to maintain synchronized datasets with regular updates while minimizing manual intervention. The combination of `Django's robust framework`, `Docker's containerization`, and `CRON's scheduling capabilities` ensures reliable and consistent data handling across the system.

By automating the import-export cycle and providing a clean interface for data management, this project significantly reduces the time and effort required for regular data maintenance while ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
