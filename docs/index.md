# Project Overview 

## CSV Data Management System with Django Admin Integration
A `Django-based` data management system that automates `CSV data processing`, provides a `customized admin interface`, and maintains data synchronization through `scheduled exports`.

---

## Detailed Description

### Core Functionality
The system serves as a bridge between `CSV data sources` and a `PostgreSQL database`, featuring a `custom Django admin panel` for data visualization and management. It implements `automated data handling` through periodic exports, ensuring `data consistency and backup`.

---

### Key Components

#### Data Import System
The import system manages CSV data ingestion through:

- Dedicated interface for CSV file uploads with comprehensive error handling.
- Intelligent parsing and validation of incoming CSV data.
- Flexible column mapping between CSV and database fields.
- Detailed validation reporting and error notifications.

#### Custom Admin Interface
The enhanced Django admin panel features:

- Tailored data views with intuitive navigation.
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities.
- Customizable data presentation with dynamic sorting.
- Granular role-based access control system.

#### Database Integration
PostgreSQL integration includes:

- Robust database schema optimized for CSV data structures.
- Efficient query optimization and data retrieval patterns.
- Strong data integrity constraints and validation rules.
- Automated backup and recovery procedures.

#### Automated Export System
The Cron-based export system provides:

- Automated tasks running at 60-minute intervals.
- Systematic CSV file generation from the current database state.
- Organized file naming conventions for easy tracking.
- Comprehensive export history management.

- django-cron job facilitating scheduled tasks.
- Custom management commands for CSV processing.

### Database
PostgreSQL implementation includes:

- Primary data storage with optimized performance.
- Strategic indexing for frequently accessed data.
- Reliable backup and recovery mechanisms.
- Data integrity maintenance protocols.

### File Management
File handling system features:

- Organized storage hierarchy for imports and exports.
- Automatic cleanup routines for outdated files.
- Version control system for change tracking.
- Efficient storage space management.
